<h1>Project Description</h1>
The Planner application serves as a tool for managing daily events, tasks and habits, similar to an agenda. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) designed with Java Swing library and consists of two main windows.

The first window displays the daily planner. Here, users can view the task list for the current day, add new tasks, and mark them as done. You can move between days using forward and backward arrows or by directly entering a date. Doubly-linked list structure is used to allow switch between consecutive days.

The second window is the habit tracker. It displays a list of habits along with their respective streak values, indicating how long each habit has been repeated without a break, as well as the total number of completions. The 'current' shows the most recent progress, while the 'longest' shows the best progress to date. The heap structure is used to display the longest streak.
